### What is Delegate?
> An object that knows how to call a method(or a group of methods)   
> A reference or pointer to a function

### Why do we need delegates?
>For designing extensible and flexible application(eg frameworks)

### How to create delegate and how to use it?
```
//This is a class including many photo filters
public class PhotoFilters
{
    public void ApplyBrightness(Photo photo)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("apply brightness...")    
    }
    public void ApplyMakeBeauty(Photo photo)
    ...
    public void ApplyBrightness(Photo photo)
    ...
    public void ApplyBrightness(Photo photo)
    ...
}

//There is a PhotoProcesser class
public class PhotoProcesser
{
    public delegate void PhotoFilterHandler(Photo photo);          //Create delegate
    
    public void Process(Photo photo, PhotoFilterHandler photoFilterHandler)
    {
        photoFilterHandler(photo);                                 //use the delegate
    }
}

// In main function
public static void Main()
{
    var processer = new PhotoProcesser();
    var photo = new Photo();
    var filters = new PhotoFilters();
    PhotoProcessor.PhotoFilterHanler filterHandler = filters.ApplyBrightness;  //add function to the delegate
    filterHandler += filter.ApplyMakeBeauty;                       //add function to the delegate
    
    processer.Process(photo, filterHandler)
}
```

### Exist delegates?
>`Action<T>` and `Func<Tin TReturn>`  
`Action<Photo> filterHandler`. it takes Photo typy and return void.  

### How to decide when to use delegate or interface?
>Use A delegate when   
>1.An eventing design pattern is used  
>2.The caller doesn't need to access other properties or method on the object implementing the method.
